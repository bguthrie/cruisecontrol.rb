== Welcome to Rails

Rails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything
needed to create database-backed web-applications according to the
Model-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also
called the presentation) into "dumb" templates that are primarily responsible
for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the
"smart" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all
the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The
controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update
Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.

In Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping
layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from
database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic
methods. You can read more about Active Record in
link:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.

The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers
are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is
unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much
more separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of
Rails.  You can read more about Action Pack in
link:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.


== Getting started

1. At the command prompt, start a new rails application using the rails command
   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp
   (If you've downloaded rails in a complete tgz or zip, this step is already done)
2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get "Welcome aboard: You‚Äôre riding the Rails!"
4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application


== Web Servers

By default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise
Rails will use the WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,
Rails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures
that you can always get up and running quickly.

Mongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C-component (which requires compilation) that is
suitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,
getting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.
More info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org

If Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than
Mongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional
installation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged
to start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from
http://www.lighttpd.net.

And finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby
web server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not
for production.

But of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.
Apache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,
please visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI


== Debugging Rails

Have "tail -f" commands running on the server.log and development.log. Rails will
automatically display debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging
info will also be shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.


== Breakpoints

Breakpoint support is available through the script/breakpointer client. This
means that you can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate
and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:

  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
    def index
      @posts = Post.find(:all)
      breakpoint "Breaking out from the list"
    end
  end

So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you
with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things like:

Executing breakpoint "Breaking out from the list" at .../webrick_server.rb:16 in 'breakpoint'

  >> @posts.inspect
  => "[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>,
       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\"title\"=>\"Rails you know!\", \"body\"=>\"Only ten..\", \"id\"=>\"2\"}>]"
  >> @posts.first.title = "hello from a breakpoint"
  => "hello from a breakpoint"

...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:

  >> f = @posts.first
  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={"title"=>nil, "body"=>nil, "id"=>"1"}>
  >> f.
  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)

Finally, when you're ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D


== Console

You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.
Here you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the
application is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the
database. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.
Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.

To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>

== Description of contents

app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController
  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.

app/models
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.

app/views
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblogs/index.rhtml for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby
  syntax.

app/views/layouts
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common
  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the
  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.rhtml. Inside default.rhtml,
  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.

app/helpers
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated
  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to
  wrap functionality for your views into methods.

config
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.

components
  Self-contained mini-applications that can bundle together controllers, models, and views.

db
  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all
  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.

doc
  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated
  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>

lib
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't
  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.

public
  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,
  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be
  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.

script
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.

test
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template
  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.

vendor
  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.
  This directory is in the load path.

# General Apache options

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
Options +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI

# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,
# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests
# 
# Example:
#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*
#   RewriteRule .* - [L]

# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails
# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow
# 
# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one
#
# Example:
#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]
RewriteEngine On

# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,
# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.
#
# Example:
#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public
#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp

RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]

# In case Rails experiences terminal errors
# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead
# 
# Example:
#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html

# You may specify the path to the FastCGI crash log (a log of unhandled
# exceptions which forced the FastCGI instance to exit, great for debugging)
# and the number of requests to process before running garbage collection.
#
# By default, the FastCGI crash log is RAILS_ROOT/log/fastcgi.crash.log
# and the GC period is nil (turned off).  A reasonable number of requests
# could range from 10-100 depending on the memory footprint of your app.
#
# Example:
#   # Default log path, normal GC behavior.
#   RailsFCGIHandler.process!
#
#   # Default log path, 50 requests between GC.
#   RailsFCGIHandler.process! nil, 50
#
#   # Custom log path, normal GC behavior.
#   RailsFCGIHandler.process! '/var/log/myapp_fcgi_crash.log'

// Autocompleter.Base handles all the autocompletion functionality 
// that's independent of the data source for autocompletion. This
// includes drawing the autocompletion menu, observing keyboard
// and mouse events, and similar.
//
// Specific autocompleters need to provide, at the very least, 
// a getUpdatedChoices function that will be invoked every time
// the text inside the monitored textbox changes. This method 
// should get the text for which to provide autocompletion by
// invoking this.getToken(), NOT by directly accessing
// this.element.value. This is to allow incremental tokenized
// autocompletion. Specific auto-completion logic (AJAX, etc)
// belongs in getUpdatedChoices.
//
// Tokenized incremental autocompletion is enabled automatically
// when an autocompleter is instantiated with the 'tokens' option
// in the options parameter, e.g.:
// new Ajax.Autocompleter('id','upd', '/url/', { tokens: ',' });
// will incrementally autocomplete with a comma as the token.
// Additionally, ',' in the above example can be replaced with
// a token array, e.g. { tokens: [',', '\n'] } which
// enables autocompletion on multiple tokens. This is most 
// useful when one of the tokens is \n (a newline), as it 
// allows smart autocompletion after linebreaks.

// The local array autocompleter. Used when you'd prefer to
// inject an array of autocompletion options into the page, rather
// than sending out Ajax queries, which can be quite slow sometimes.
//
// The constructor takes four parameters. The first two are, as usual,
// the id of the monitored textbox, and id of the autocompletion menu.
// The third is the array you want to autocomplete from, and the fourth
// is the options block.
//
// Extra local autocompletion options:
// - choices - How many autocompletion choices to offer
//
// - partialSearch - If false, the autocompleter will match entered
//                    text only at the beginning of strings in the 
//                    autocomplete array. Defaults to true, which will
//                    match text at the beginning of any *word* in the
//                    strings in the autocomplete array. If you want to
//                    search anywhere in the string, additionally set
//                    the option fullSearch to true (default: off).
//
// - fullSsearch - Search anywhere in autocomplete array strings.
//
// - partialChars - How many characters to enter before triggering
//                   a partial match (unlike minChars, which defines
//                   how many characters are required to do any match
//                   at all). Defaults to 2.
//
// - ignoreCase - Whether to ignore case when autocompleting.
//                 Defaults to true.
//
// It's possible to pass in a custom function as the 'selector' 
// option, if you prefer to write your own autocompletion logic.
// In that case, the other options above will not apply unless
// you support them.
